## 📊 Overview  

PhotoSweeper is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline photo library management by detecting duplicate and visually similar images with remarkable precision. Built for both casual users and professional photographers, it helps clean up cluttered archives, eliminate redundant versions, and organize large collections effectively.

Instead of relying solely on filenames or metadata, PhotoSweeper performs visual analysis to identify repeated shots, burst sequences, edited versions, resized copies, and images captured seconds apart. Its advanced comparison engine examines composition, color, structure, and other visual attributes, allowing for highly accurate similarity detection—even when photos differ slightly.

The app integrates seamlessly with major photo management platforms including Photos, Lightroom, and Capture One, as well as traditional folder-based libraries. Users can choose from a variety of comparison modes, adjust sensitivity settings, filter results, and inspect images through a rich set of preview tools. Modes like side-by-side comparison, group view, and timeline view help users make informed decisions quickly.

PhotoSweeper also supports automated workflows. Its auto-marking system can evaluate groups of similar images and pick the preferred version based on criteria like resolution, metadata, timeframe, or user-defined preferences. After review, users can delete duplicates, move them, or isolate them for further evaluation—ensuring a smooth, organized cleanup process.

Thanks to its optimized scanning engine, PhotoSweeper handles large libraries with speed, making it ideal for photographers dealing with thousands of RAW files or extensive personal archives accumulated over many years. Whether preparing collections for backup, optimizing storage space, or tidying up years of digital clutter, PhotoSweeper simplifies the entire process.
